Minetest mod that attempts to recreate the functionality of the minecraft mod create

basicly recreate the mechanics from create

We only aim to recreate the funcitonality,
as sutch some blocks will look different and some blocks,
that serve the same purpuse might be merged and so on

goals:
	full create funcitonality
	no hard dependencies
 
additional functionality or changes shuld be handled by addons
addons even "official" ones will be in seperate git repos


differences from create:
	not dependant on andesite. we use any cobblestone or stone
	repurpuse rather than retire old blocks	 #long live the furnace engine
